## General

My challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

My users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See all testimonials in a horizontal slider
- Receive an error message when the newsletter sign up `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
